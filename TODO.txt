Reversing slicing is an entirely different paradigm. 
When reversed, the take offset needs to be calculated with $SOURCELEN - $ITEMLEN.
This is assuming that you've clipped the length of the sample from the right side.

When clipping from the left side the length parameter needs to change.
This may be just the same as using item length

All of this needs to occur PRE command line so that the correct window is analysed
