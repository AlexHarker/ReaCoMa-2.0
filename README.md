ReaCoMa 2 is a project developed by [James Bradbury](https://jamesbradbury.xyz). The project brings the power of the [FluCoMa tools](https://www.flucoma.org) to REAPER. 

ReaCoMa 2 is a major update and improvement to the first version of ReaCoMa. It brings a number of improvements over the initial version, while still being minimal and robust. These include: 

- A new interface that leverages Dear ImGui for an immediate mode, hardware accelerated interface with sliders, drop-downs and more.
- Dockable and persistent windows, so you can keep your favourite slicers or decomposition algorithms handy.
- Real-time slicing previews.

ReaCoMa 2 is is not a replacement for ReaCoMa 1, rather, it can be seen as an enhanced version for those who donâ€™t mind installing an additional dependency and are willing to adapt their workflow. I know the value in maintaining a stable creative workflow, so ReaCoMa 1 will receive bug fixes. Ultimately it's up to you which version you want to use.

# Installation
